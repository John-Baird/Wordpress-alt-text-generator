# Wordpress-alt-text-generator
When working with Wordpress, it can be a time-costly hassle to create alt-text for thousands of images manually. But with a simple python script, some insertable javascript, and a chrome extention, this can be done automatically! No hands! Runs on almost all systems! A huge timer saver.
